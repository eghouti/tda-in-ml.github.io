| **Affiliation** | [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist) | 
| **Biography** | Robert Ghrist is the Andrea Mitchell PIK Professor of Mathematics and Electrical & Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. After earning a BS in Mechanical Engineering (University of Toledo, 1991), and the MS and PhD in Applied Mathematics (Cornell University, 1994, 1995), he held positions in Mathematics departments at the University of Texas (Austin), Georgia Tech, and the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign). He has been at Penn since 2008. Ghrist is a recognized leader in the field of Applied Algebraic Topology, with publications detailing topological methods for sensor networks, robotics, signal processing, data analysis, optimization, and more. He is the author of a leading textbook on the subject (Elementary Applied Topology, 2014), and has managed numerous large DoD grants from AFOSR, ASDRE, DARPA, and ONR. His research has been recognized with the NSF CAREER, NSF PECASE, SciAm50, and Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellow awards. Ghrist has been an invited speaker at two International Congresses of Mathematicians: once (Madrid 2006) for research and once (Seoul, 2014) for education. Ghrist is a dedicated expositor and communicator of Mathematics, with teaching awards that include the MAA James Crawford Prize, Penn's Lindback Award, and the S. Reid Warren award in Engineering at Penn. Ghrist is the author, designer, and animator of popular YouTube video texts (featuring the Calculus BLUE Project), as well as an online course on Coursera featured in the New York Times, BoingBoing, and Gizmodo. |

| **Persistent homology of complex networks for dynamic state detection in time series** |
| There has been extensive work performing time series analysis with persistence diagrams via the Takens embedding. In this talk we develop an alternative approach for studying graph representations of time series of dynamical systems. Specifically, we show how persistent homology can be used to yield a compressed, multi-scale representation of the ordinal partition network of the time series that can distinguish between dynamic states such as periodic and chaotic behavior. By replacing the network with its persistence diagram, we then extract existing as well as new geometric and entropy point summaries from the persistence diagram and compare to other commonly used network characteristics. Our results show that persistence-based point summaries yield a clearer distinction of the dynamic behavior and are more robust to noise than existing graph-based scores, especially when combined with ordinal graphs. |

| **Affiliation** | [Michigan State University](http://elizabethmunch.com) |
| **Biography** | Liz received her PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Duke University in May 2013. Prior to joining the faculty of Michigan State University, she was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University at Albany - SUNY, and a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications at the University of Minnesota for the 2013-2014 thematic year on applications of topology. She also holds a Master of Arts in Mathematics from Duke University, a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of Rochester, and a Bachelor of Music in Harp Performance from the Eastman School of Music. When she isn't thinking about TDA, she's chasing her two sons around, playing video games, or watching bad sci-fi. |

## Jose Perea

| **TALLEM -- Topological Assembly of LocalLy Euclidean Models** |
| We present here a new unsupervised topological data analysis tool for data coordinatization, fusion and distributed nonlinear dimensionality reduction. This new methodology, called TALLEM, assembles a collection of local Euclidean coordinates on the data, and leverages ideas from the theory of fiber bundles to yield a global map consistent with the underlying data topology. |

| **Affiliation** | [Michigan State University](https://www.joperea.com) |
| **Biography** | I got my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) in 2011, and a B.Sc. in Mathematics from [Universidad del Valle](https://www.univalle.edu.co/) (Summa cum laude and Valedictorian) in 2006. I was a postdoc in the department of Mathematics at [Duke](https://duke.edu) from 2011 to 2015, and a member of the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications ([IMA](https://www.ima.umn.edu/2013-2014)) at the University of Minnesota during the Fall of 2014. In August of 2015 I joined [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor with joint appointments in the department of Computational Mathematics, Science & Engineering ([CMSE](https://cmse.msu.edu)), and the department of [Mathematics](https://math.msu.edu). My work has been supported by grants from [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/), the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/), the [Center for Business and Social Analytics](http://cbsa.msu.edu/), and an [NSF CAREER award](https://www.nsf.gov/career). |
