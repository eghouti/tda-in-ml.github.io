| **Searching in the Space of Persistence Diagrams** |
| The doubling dimension of the space of persistence diagrams is infinite and, as a result, current approaches for finding the nearest neighbor to a persistence diagram among a set of other persistence diagrams is either linear in the number of diagrams or does not offer performance guarantees.  This talk will present the first algorithm that supports approximate nearest neighbor search in the space of persistence diagrams using the bottleneck distance. |

Reid Warren award in Engineering at Penn. Ghrist is the author, designer, and animator of popular YouTube video texts (featuring the Calculus BLUE Project), as well as an online course on Coursera featured in the New York Times, BoingBoing, and Gizmodo. |

## Kathryn Hess

| **Topological insights in neuroscience** |
| I will describe two applications of TDA in neuroscience that provide intriguing insights into the relation between between structure and function in networks of neurons. |

| **Affiliation** | [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/hessbellwald-lab/hessbellwald) |
| **Biography** | Kathryn Hess is a professor of mathematics and life sciences at the EPFL.  She received her PhD from MIT and held positions at the universities of Stockholm, Nice, and Toronto before moving to the EPFL. Her research focuses on algebraic topology and its applications, primarily in the life sciences, but also in materials science. On the applied side, she has elaborated methods based on topological data analysis for high-throughput screening of nanoporous crystalline materials, classification and synthesis of neuron morphologies, and classification of neuronal network dynamics.  She has also developed and applied innovative topological approaches to network theory, leading to a powerful, parameter-free mathematical framework relating the activity of a neural network to its underlying structure, both locally and globally. In 2016 she was elected to Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences and was named a fellow of the American Mathematical Society and a distinguished speaker of the European Mathematical Society in 2017. |

## Liz Munch

| **Persistent homology of complex networks for dynamic state detection in time series** |
| There has been extensive work performing time series analysis with persistence diagrams via the Takens embedding. In this talk we develop an alternative approach for studying graph representations of time series of dynamical systems. Specifically, we show how persistent homology can be used to yield a compressed, multi-scale representation of the ordinal partition network of the time series that can distinguish between dynamic states such as periodic and chaotic behavior. By replacing the network with its persistence diagram, we then extract existing as well as new geometric and entropy point summaries from the persistence diagram and compare to other commonly used network characteristics. Our results show that persistence-based point summaries yield a clearer distinction of the dynamic behavior and are more robust to noise than existing graph-based scores, especially when combined with ordinal graphs. |

| **Biography** | Liz received her PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Duke University in May 2013. Prior to joining the faculty of Michigan State University, she was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University at Albany - SUNY, and a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications at the University of Minnesota for the 2013-2014 thematic year on applications of topology. She also holds a Master of Arts in Mathematics from Duke University, a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of Rochester, and a Bachelor of Music in Harp Performance from the Eastman School of Music. When she isn't thinking about TDA, she's chasing her two sons around, playing video games, or watching bad sci-fi. |

## Jose Perea

| **TALLEM -- Topological Assembly of LocalLy Euclidean Models** |
| We present here a new unsupervised topological data analysis tool for data coordinatization, fusion and distributed nonlinear dimensionality reduction. This new methodology, called TALLEM, assembles a collection of local Euclidean coordinates on the data, and leverages ideas from the theory of fiber bundles to yield a global map consistent with the underlying data topology. |

| **Industrial Application of TDA-ML technology**: Achievement so far and expectations of future |
| As DX (Digital Transformation) has been becoming a big key word among almost all industrial players, AI practitioners got many chances to tackle more complex data, which they've not met before. Topological Data Analysis has been recently attracting attention of AI practitioners/Data scientists. Because, TDA would have a great potential to extract hidden features, which current technologies have not successfully found, from complex data by combining with ML technologies.  In this session, I present several industrial use cases of TDA-ML and show TDA-ML capability, which would provide great benefit to DX industries. |
