| **Affiliation** | [Skoltech & Paris Diderot University](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/serguei.barannikov) |
| **Biography** | Serguei Barannikov received his PhD in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley (1999). He is a leading research scientist at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology. He also holds a position as a CNRS researcher at Paris Diderot University.  He worked as a researcher in mathematics at Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques and at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris.  At the age of 20, Barannikov wrote a paper on algebraic topology, in which he introduced "canonical form" invariants of filtered complexes, together with an efficient algorithm for their calculation. Ten years later, these invariants became widely used in topological data analysis under the name of "persistence barcodes" and "persistence diagrams". Dr. Barannikov's recent interests focus on applying  topological data analysis methods to reveal patterns in learning of neural networks. |

## Lorin Crawford

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/lc.jpg" alt="Lorin Crawford" height="250px" /> |
| **A Machine Learning Pipeline for Feature Selection and Association Mapping with 3D Shapes** |
| It has been a long-standing challenge to implement an analogue of variable selection with 3D shapes as the covariates in a regression model. Here, we present SINATRA, a statistical pipeline for sub-image selection where the goal is to identify the physical features of 3D shapes that best explain the variation between two trait classes. A key insight is that, one can use tools from differential topology to transform objects represented as meshes into a collection of vectors (with little to no loss of information about their natural structure).  Since this topological transformation is invertible, SINATRA uses an interpretable machine learning algorithm to map significant vector indices back onto the original shapes — thus, highlighting the physical 3D shape characteristics that best distinguish members in the two groups. As an application of our pipeline, we conduct feature selection on a dataset consisting of mandibular molars from five different genera of New World Monkeys and examine the physical properties of their teeth that best characterize their dietary regimens. |

| **Searching in the Space of Persistence Diagrams** |
| The doubling dimension of the space of persistence diagrams is infinite and, as a result, current approaches for finding the nearest neighbor to a persistence diagram among a set of other persistence diagrams is either linear in the number of diagrams or does not offer performance guarantees.  This talk will present the first algorithm that supports approximate nearest neighbor search in the space of persistence diagrams using the bottleneck distance. |

## Yasu Hiraoka

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/yh.jpg" alt="Yasu Hiraoka" height="250px" /> |
| **Characterizing rare events in persistent homology** |
| Indecomposables obtained through decompositions of persistent homology are regarded as topological summary of real data. However, as is well known, there exist pathologically complicated indecomposables in multi-parameter persistent homology in purely algebraic setting, and this fact makes it difficult to build mathematical theory on that setting. Our fundamental question is, how much should we care about such complicated indecomposables in the real data, and what is a suitable framework to study this question? To this aim, we will show several ongoing results, especially, (1) large deviation principle on 1 parameter persistent homology, and (2) law of large numbers on multi-parameter persistent homology. Then we will discuss how these two results (partially) answer to the original question. |

By combining various mathematical theories such as topology, representation theory, probability theory, he succeeded in making TDA powerful and general for practical problems. In applications, he has organized the materials TDA team, and his group achieved several pioneering results on structural analysis in materials science based on TDA. In particular, a series of methods developed by his group using persistent homology, machine learning, and inverse analysis are expected to be a key technology for materials informatics in future. In addition to materials science, he has recently launched TDA projects on other application areas such as life science and economics. |

## Facundo Mémoli

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/fm.jpg" alt="Facundo Mémoli" height="250px" /> |
| **Spatiotemporal Persistent Homology for Dynamic Metric Spaces** |
| Characterizing the dynamics of time-evolving data within the framework of topological data analysis (TDA) has been attracting increasingly more attention. Popular instances of time-evolving data include flocking/swarming behaviors in animals and social networks in the human sphere. A natural mathematical model for such collective behaviors is a dynamic point cloud, or more generally a dynamic metric space (DMS).  We show how to extend the Rips filtration stability result for (static) metric spaces to the setting of DMSs, while retaining stability. We identify polynomial time computable invariants and associated pseudodistances, and provide software implementations which can be used for practical tasks. This is joint work with Woojin Kim (Duke) and Nate Clause (OSU); see <https://github.com/ndag/PHoDMSs>. |

## Liz Munch

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/em.jpg" alt="Liz Munch" height="250px" /> |
| **Persistent homology of complex networks for dynamic state detection in time series** |
| There has been extensive work performing time series analysis with persistence diagrams via the Takens embedding. In this talk we develop an alternative approach for studying graph representations of time series of dynamical systems. Specifically, we show how persistent homology can be used to yield a compressed, multi-scale representation of the ordinal partition network of the time series that can distinguish between dynamic states such as periodic and chaotic behavior. By replacing the network with its persistence diagram, we then extract existing as well as new geometric and entropy point summaries from the persistence diagram and compare to other commonly used network characteristics. Our results show that persistence-based point summaries yield a clearer distinction of the dynamic behavior and are more robust to noise than existing graph-based scores, especially when combined with ordinal graphs. |

## Vidit Nanda

| **Singularity detection in data** |
| I will describe a new and efficient topological technique to detect manifold-intersections and other singularities directly from finite point samples. The method makes use of local persistent homology computations around tiny annular neighborhoods of sampled data points, and works even when none of those points have been sampled from the singular regions. All of this is joint work with B Stolz, H Harrington and J Tanner. |

| **Wasserstein Stability for Persistence Diagrams** |
| The stability of persistence diagrams is among the most important results in applied and computational topology but most results are with respect to the bottleneck distance between diagrams. This has two main implications: it makes the space of persistence diagrams rather pathological and it is often provides very pessimistic bounds with respect to outliers. In this talk I will discuss new stability results with respect to the p-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams. The foundations are cellular stability functions on sufficiently finite spaces in terms of the p-norm of the perturbations. This has applications to image analysis, persistence homology transforms and Vietoris-Rips complexes. This is joint work with Primoz Skraba. |

## Bei Wang

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/bw.jpg" alt="Bei Wang" height="250px" /> |
| **Topology and Neuron Activations in Deep Learning** |
| Deep convolutional neural networks have become ubiquitous in image classification tasks thanks to architectures such as GoogLeNet and ResNet. However, we do not quite understand how these networks achieve their impressive performance. The main challenge in deep learning is the interpretability: How can we make the representations learned by these networks human interpretable? Given a trained deep neural network, we can address the interpretability issue by probing neuron activations, that is, the combinations of neuron firings, in response to a particular input image. With millions of input images, we can obtain a global view of what the neurons have learned by studying neuron activations at a particular layer and across multiple layers.  We aim to shed light on the following questions using topological tools: What is the shape of the activation space? What is the organizational principle behind neuron activations? |

| **Industrial Application of TDA-ML technology**: Achievement so far and expectations of future |
| As DX (Digital Transformation) has been becoming a big key word among almost all industrial players, AI practitioners got many chances to tackle more complex data, which they've not met before. Topological Data Analysis has been recently attracting attention of AI practitioners/Data scientists. Because, TDA would have a great potential to extract hidden features, which current technologies have not successfully found, from complex data by combining with ML technologies.  In this session, I present several industrial use cases of TDA-ML and show TDA-ML capability, which would provide great benefit to DX industries. |
