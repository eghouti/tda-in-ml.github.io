We welcome all original research papers of up to 4 pages in length. This
length does not include references or any supplementary materials. Reviewers 
are *not* obliged to read supplementary materials when reviewing the paper.
Submissions should be a single file in `.pdf` format. The review process
is *double-blind*, so please ensure that all papers are appropriately
anonymised.

We also welcome extended abstracts of up to 2 pages in length that
describe open problems, novel applications, or challenges in
*Topological Data Analysis*, *Topological Machine Learning*, and related
areas. Again, this length does not include references or any supplementary
materials. We also permit papers that have been recently published or are
under submission to another venue. Please mark such papers accordingly upon
submission.

Accepted papers and extended abstracts will be presented as brief talks
of 5--7 minutes length. Authors will also have the option to present
their work in a live session.

All accepted papers will be archived on OpenReview.
